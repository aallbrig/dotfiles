# Andrew Allbright dotfiles
Personal dotfiles. This is an upgrade from my ansible based computer setup scripts.

## Installation

Download this repo locally. Run this script. The script is intentionally idempotent so please run it multiple times ðŸ˜Ž
```bash
./fresh.sh
```

## Privileged access setup

I didn't want to have to deal with sudo every time the script is run. Use this script to setup items that require root privileges.
```bash
./admin_setup.sh
```
